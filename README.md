# the-safer-cyclist
This project was created for our Digital Design Lab (SYDE 192L). We decided to create a arduino light system that would eventually be integrated into a cyclist jacket. This system would incorporate 2 lights controlled by 2 separate buttons to signal left or right, along with a proximity detector that would light up a red light when an object (vehicle) gets too close to the biker.
